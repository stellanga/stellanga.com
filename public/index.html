      <p>My name is Stellan Garhammar and I'm a freelance web developer / front-end developer / codemonkey with my basecamp in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
      <p>I love creating things, primarily for the web but also for other mediums and in other forms. I have a background in computer science and during the years I've had the pleasure of working with a bunch of great people and different technologies.</p>
      <p>If you or your company is looking for someone to help out with web development I'd love to hear from you. Check out my resume and drop me a mail.</p>
